JSON Beautifier
===============

This is a program I created a while ago to take a raw JSON string and format
it to be human readable.

The actual logic is offloaded to the python json library.

This was created before Firefox, Chrome, etc. added tools to do this for you,
and so I mostly keep it around because it's a decent boilerplate example for
using pyside2.
